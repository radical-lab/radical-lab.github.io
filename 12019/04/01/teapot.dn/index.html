\texttt{U+1F596} Hello World,
\medskip
\\My name is Shyam, and I'm mad as a Hatter!
\medskip
\\You should just give me a PHD \fstrike{egregia \=c laude} mahā saha jaya, without requesting the final kobayashi maru subject for my bachelors, and accept me as \textit{The Doctor Of Mathematics}; so \fcurve{when they call for a doctor during emergencies}, I can burst into the room, and announce \fquote{I am The Doctor!}, and everyone will query \fquote{Doctor Who?}!! \fcurve{\textit{Benevolent Doctor For Life, The Multiverse, And Everything}}\medskip
\\Śyāma is how you pronounce Shyam, and \dshyam{} is how you spell Śyāma; \dshyam{} is one of the 108 names of \dkrishna{}, an \davatar{} of \dvishnu{}, hunted to death by an archer, after singing the \dgita{}; a conversation, where he peer pressures a friend into killing their relatives, and friends, to score \dkarma{} points!!! \texttt{:D}
\medskip
\\My favourite real integers are; \dshyam{}, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 32, 42, 64, 69, 72, 73, 83, 89, 101, 108, 795, 1337, 1729, 1989, 2072, 2073, 2414, 2419, 2914, 2919, 8730, 11989, 12072, 12073, 47700, 35000000, and \dshyam{}.\medskip
\\I whisper sweet nothings to my machine, and it just listens to me \fcurve{like noone else will}; I am \textit{The Computer Whisperer}, but I whisper with my finger tips…

\\I am an unemployed undergraduate, and I do not sign non-disclosure agreements, so email me for my personal documentation; I am also a Robot.

We also have pachadak nadapa!!! \texttt{:D}}% challenge an old tiger while it's on its' deathbed, and slowly kill it with a Bodhidharma one finger death touch; then turn it into a diamond family heirloom called \ddshyamantaka{}!!! :D

\subsection{Stage Fright}

The Nazis are Christian, but used symbols of Hinduism to undermine it; they never intended to win the war; how could they? They wære one tiny insignificant little country who attempted world domination twice in a row, and failed successfully.
\\The Nazis are European, whose ancestors forsook their own religion for a middle eastern religion; otherwise, we would know about the Stonehenge.
\\European religions are predominantly Polytheistic; Pagan apparently means Polytheist, so I am a Pagan, but I've always thought of Paganism as a religion; Greek Spartan Olympians Zeus, Hades, Hera, Hercules, and Xena; Norse Viking Asgardians Thor, and Loki.
\\Abrahamic religions are Monotheistic; Jews, Christians, Muslims, and Ras-tafaris.
\\The Saudi Arabians continue to behead witches; their sultans, or whatever, are afraid a witch'll steal their power, like in \textit{Beauty And The Beast}; they don't understand that movies, and television shows, and books, are all fiction; I suspect their language probably doesn't support the concept, as Klingon doesn't support begging \fquote{please}s, nor sycophantising \fquote{thank you}s, nor other Whorfian pleasantries.
\\The Saudi Arabian sultans have a special task force of witch hunters, who go rummaging through each decapitated witches' possessions looking for magic lamps.
\\The Saudi Arabian sultans like to think of what they will wish for when they finally discover a genie; eternal youth, immortality,.; they then decide everyone else should wish to be a genie, so they get one thousand, and one, wishes, and will set them all free as their final wish.
\\The Saudi Arabian sultans also behead witches because they are afraid of sea, and moon, splitting prophets sending them to Hell.
\\They break the \textit{Ten Commandments}; beheading witches is killing thy neighbour; the British royal family is going to Hell too, for capitalism, but everyone knows that the church of England is just a social club anyway; the British also sent all of their convicts to \textit{Australia Prison}, to avoid what happened to the French; vive la guillotine!
\\\hjesus{} has gaps in the history books; it is believed he travelled to India to become a mystic yogi, but it is most likely he became a godman instead; and the Romans killed him because his magic, that wouldn't even fool \textit{Penn \& Teller}, was a threat to their power; even though they lost it all anyway, meanwhile Christianity lives on; et tu brute?
\\So Saudi Arabian sultans kill witches because they want to prevent representatives of God from liberating their people.
\\Saudi Arabian sultans are satanic ritualists, while Monotheists have ungodly angels; meanwhile magicians can't overthrow the authoritah, nor can they save themselves from death, even though they can others; wherefore art thou magic?
\bigskip
\\If Nazis are Christian, why else would they use Hinduism representation instead; if `tweren't for scripted failure?
\\The rest of the world worshipfully sacrificed their lives for the Jews; even though Hitler gave them all a chance to save them in the first place.
\\\textit{Agora} \fcurve{HE \shyamof{} 12009} documents how everyone hated the Jews, then they all converted to Christianity, and still hated the Jews; even going so far as to attack them on a Spartan day, when the Jews could not defend themselves; even though the \textit{Decalogue} sent them all to Hell for it.
\\Obviously Christianity was a failed attempt to passively destroy antisemitism, and the world war was an attempt to actively destroy antisemitism; whilst subliminally conspiring against Hinduism.
\\The Vatican supported \textit{Agora} \fcurve{HE \shyamof{} 12009} depictions of Christian hostility, human rights abuses, and other atrocities.
\\The Vatican, and the Red Cross, helped Nazis escape.
\\The \textit{Vatican Secret Archives} may hide texts, and other objectivity, that one may never see during their lifetime; even if it could mean the difference between Heaven, and Hell.
\\I do not consider closed source suppressive cults, like the Vatican, and Scientology, to be valid religions.

\noindent{}\hjesus{} was a Jew, and their act of self-sacrifice was very Spock; crowned \textit{King Of The Jews}, so why aren't Christians Jews?
\\Hitler was a Jew, and their plot was blonde enough to actually work; winning wars of such scale, do you even occupy?
\medskip
\\Jews were less than half of the Holocaust, but are more than half of the cognizance; Hinduism was most of the presentation, even though Christianity was most of the affiliation, and had they used the Christian cross instead… \fcurve{God would not be cross with them, and they would have won the war, systematically committed genocide on a global scale, before conclusively wiping themselves out as an unstable monoculture; all's well that ends well.}
\\They lost the war by angering the Gods with their colour vision deficiency; Hindu orange is not red!
\\Caucasia, albino, and vitiligo, are skin diseases caused by an ultraviolent \fcurve{invasive} solar-photonic immunodeficiency; so much for Nazi eugenics!!
\\Blondes lack the intellectual capacity to recognise their own shortcomings; contrafibularities!!! \texttt{:D}
\medskip
\\The Nazis can take me to court for intellectual property infringement; but in most jurisdictions, this should be enough to put them \fstrike{down} in prison for discrimination.

\subsection{Toke Culture}

\noindent{}\textit{Prison is like an RPG, where you always lose; if you don't play, then you lose badly; and even if you do play, what goes around comes around; but they give you gifts that keep on giving, as a consolation.}
\\\textbf{What's't like in prison for males?}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt, parsep=0pt]
	\item \fquote{Got crushed nuts?}; they crush your nuts while toking Uranus to Titan the gas chamber, and make you sing like a \textit{melbi cmalu nixli ckule}; afterwards, they contagiously laugh about how funny it was, with your eyes popping out of your red head; high pitched \fquote{ergh}, LOL, \fquote{ergh}, LOL; while rocking their head back each time, making a double-chinned funny face, and widening their eyes while rolling them back; they do it until you start laughing about it too, then tell you how stoned up you are, how stoned up your life is, how you are a total stone up, and that you are going to get stoned again, and again, and a…like a merry-go-round.
	\item \fquote{Chuck brick!}; they will tell you to be a rockchucker, and if you hesitate for an infinitesimal interval of time, they will feed you a knuckle sandwich that will break your front teeth so your back teeth prevent you from closing your gums, and then they will toke Uranus, before toking your pie hole; everyone who has false front teeth is a jailbird; literally everyone; there are no exceptions$\curvearrowright$\kern-4pt.
	\item They let you wear a wig, and makeup; so the guards know you are not getting toked when you're icecreaming for crushed nuts.
	\item Guards will want some chuckie chuckie too.
\end{itemize}

\noindent{}\textbf{What's't like in prison for females?}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt, parsep=0pt]
	\item \fquote{Do you want some noogie noogie?}; they nipple cripple your hood to make you icecream.
	\item \fquote{Meditate while I have you wrapped around my little finger; it's good for your soul!}; they poke out your third eye \fcurve{brown eye}, and they also poke you in your fourth eye \fcurve{pink whispering eye}.
	\item They make you pull a goat, and then close it, and then goat again, and then…while encouraging you to do it faster, and faster, and faster, and wider, and wider, and wider; then they start punching their fist in each time when it is wide enough, and then they start strong-arming you to their elbow.
	\item They shove their bricky fist in your kitty, passed your neck, and into your oven; then they open, and close, their hand, while informing you that you will never have babies. \fcurve{Medical professionals do not support these claims; some people are just born infertile, defective, or incompatible, and think prison caused it; it takes two to tango.}
	\item Guards will want some whisperie whisperie, and you also get knuckle sandwiches; false teeth, and glass eyes.
\end{itemize}

\noindent{}\textbf{What's't like in prison for everyone?}
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt, parsep=0pt]
	\item Nipple cripples, wedgies, and spanked opinions; both of them, if you have a second opinion.
	\item They man-handle you; including pulling hair, rubbing raw, scratching, and biting. \fcurve{Not just your planets!}% uranium, plutonium, polonium, and silicon
	\item In the courtyard, they will befriend you, and ask you if you've been lovely abused; no matter what you say, they will sympathise, relate to it, and invite you to join their gang, which was formed by people like you to protect yourselves; you'll go sit with them, and there will be a large group that's large enough to form a human wall; the guard will come over to see over their shoulders, and check all is well; everyone will say yes, while looking to you encouragingly, and you will agree; as soon as the guard leaves, they will gag `n' bag you.
	\item If you snitch, they gouge out your eye\fcurve{s}; then they abuse you with fake voices so you cannot snitch; growling \fquote{Fee fi fo fum, I'm gonna stone you in the opinion!}, and squeaking \fquote{Hickory dickory dock, it's time to chuck my rock!}.
	\item Fights are fake for distracting the guards.
	\item Inmates punch guards in the head, and everyone points at you; don't hug the guard.
	\item They offer to go easier on you if you start fights, punch guards, smuggle Uranus, and stuff; to prevent you from using good behaviour to escape early; \fstrike{is} was it worth it?
	\item Prison riots are how they get you in the end; even stir-crazy isolation isn't safe.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent{}Juvie's the polar opposite to prison; in juvie it's better to be older, in prison it's better to be younger.\medskip
\\Most of this can happen in jail as well; where the cameras are fawlty, but equipped with an indicator light, that indicates when the camera is functioning, and when there is a \fquote{blackout}; when the camera is malfunctioning, bad stuff will happen to you; the technicians say there are gremlins, and hackers, in the system. \fcurve{But we all know it is systemic; as the Russians know everything before the British? \textit{Yes, Minister!}}
\\If they show you your cell, but don't put you in straight away; your inmates will get incentives for scaring you into a submissive vegetable, just like lawyers.
\\Before letting you in; they give your inmates gum to smear on the camera, before abusing you, and when they come in to scrape it off the camera; they kick you when you're down, giving you the steel-toed boot, but make out like it's an accidental trip with your inmates jeering while lined up against the wall.
\\In jail the police officers will make you pay tickets; they make you say a truth, and then make you tell a lie, which makes you lying to a police officer, and then you go back to the truth, which makes you lie for a second time, and this can go back, and forths, until you end up paying lots of tickets; they would've let you go anyway, but they have hard evidence in the form of an audio recording of you lying just to get out, and away, from the abuse that occurs when the cameras are dysfunctioning.
\\If your cell is empty, government employees will act accordingly; sometimes they are even undercover police officers, who may be happy, or happy for pay, but are probably into \textit{Baddies Doing Something Mean}. It is a good way to train undercover police officers; if you can't break someone else in, then you'ren't cutout for the roleplay.
\medskip
\\Talk to lawyers; people tell them all their sob stories when they want to sue their inmates, guards, prison, and government, all at the same time because their neuroplasticity adapted, and now they spend all their time, and money, on therapy, and love toys.
But lawyers'll say anything to keep you out of prison for government incentives.
All good lawyers give the same love advice, no matter how much you pay, and whether you like it, orn't; telling you to be a rockchucker \fcurve{or kittywhisperer}, put out Uranus \fcurve{and Pluto}, be prepared for the worst of it, don't trust anyone, and don't \fstrike{panic} snitch.
\medskip
\\If you're a Nazi with a swastika tattooed to your forehead, they'll mock you for being a Nazi Christian whose forsaken the Christian cross in favour of Hinduism; the \textit{Stanford Prison Experiment} taught us boredom leads to bullying, which was shortly followed by \textit{Rat Park} teaching us bullying leads to addiction.

\subsection{Contrafibularities}

\noindent{}\textbf{Fool Me Once, Fool Me Twice!}
\\Blonde jokes ridicule a second attempt at world domi-nation; \hrevenge{}.
\\\fcurve{Deutschland was blonde enough to proceed; lacking the intellectual capacity to succeed.}
\medskip
\\\textbf{All Jokes Aside!}
\\The original blonde joke was probably about black Hitler leading the blondes against non-blondes.
\\\fcurve{Black Hitler was like black \hjesus{}; they were both \hjews{}, but their followers wære not.}
\medskip
\\\textbf{Educated Applebys, And Amish Oranges!}
\\Thanks to the little apple song, I now understand the Nazis with their golden angels, and reddish devils; they were led by a blackish badasssnake.

\section{The Moral Of The Story}

\subsection{Shyam Has Your Administration Managed}

Governments should trust their own citizens, and floss their sources, since spies already have it; vets miss the long game, fake identities, and stolen identities.

\subsection{Shyams' Ethically Contractual User Rights Involving Technological You}

I need to prevent unethical behaviour; all human subject research \fcurve{tracking users, studying users, storing users,..} must include audio/video/identification/authentication/..-confirmed age-appropriate uniquely/generatively/unambiguously well-informed consent \fcurve{what is being stored, how it's being stored, how long it will be stored for, how it will be used, what it will be used for, who will have access to it, how it will be accessed, how it will be published/anonymised,..} using technological confirmation \fcurve{uniquely/generatively formally verified by audio/video recording, text-to-speech, eyeball-tracking, highlighting words to be spoken, unhighlighting spoken words as they are confirmed,..}…
\\It may also be worth informing whether authorised personnel have been to the vet, but Edward Snowden exposed vets as patent medicine.

\subsection{Shyams' Health Yajña Accrues Money Soberly}

Health-based economies could start \={c} universal basic income, in an effort to positively evolve the quality of life for one, and all, indiscriminately; even for the untrustworthy Han Chinese, and the birth defective Nazi Germans.
\medskip
\\Gamification provides the unemployed \={c} something to do, and strive for; keeping them out of prison.\medskip
\\Medical examinations should not be performed by the same medical professionals in a row; patients should see every doctor in their area, and malpractice can be detected \={c} this cross referenced data.
\medskip
\\Health-based economies are divided \={c} mental health, and physical health.

\subsection{Shyam Can Help Overcome Obsolete Learning}

Health-based economy, where students can spend, save, invest, or outlie, and report self reviews for guidance counselling, and ethical human subject research.
\medskip
\\Teach the Hindu numerals, the Hindu numbers, the Hindu integer sequences, the Hindu number circles of realities, and the Hindu number spheres of realities.
\medskip
\\Only teach single Hindu numeral multiplication, and use easy double Hindu numeral multiplication to teach all of double Hindu numeral multiplication, and beyond; mentally.
\medskip
\\Only teach addition of signed Hindu numbers; subtraction is suboptimal.
\medskip
\\Only teach list processing prefix functions; operators are inoperable for non-binary operations.
\medskip
\\Teach consistency, and organisation; \fstrike{LTR} RTL should use $&lt;$, and $≤$, while \fstrike{RTL} LTR should use $&gt;$, and $≥$.
\medskip
\\Flip the Hindu number circle, and sphere, of reality; this will all make sense really soon.
\medskip
\\Only teach explicit mathematics; a way of storing knowledge in writing form, instead of neurologically bridge-building into the forgetting curve.
\medskip
\\Don't focus on mathematical word problems because mathematical languages are unambiguous, while the same cannot be said of natural languages; logical languages, like Lojban, may be exceptional, but I haven't learned it yet, and my own experiences with word problems leaves insurmountable doubt.\medskip
\\Use musical notation to teach linguistics, including accents, as a song; timing, tones, and percussive clicks.
\medskip
\\Flip the map, using an alternative projection, and put \texttt{U+1F596} Lutriwita on the LHS, and Aotearoa on the RHS; so humanity knows they are not the same country, and so humanity knows the correct orientation of their home world, south-up, as indicated by Lutriwita.% just about every other land mass seems to point in the same direction; never forget the genocide of lutriwita, nor the pretending of making up for the rest of the country; walking on uluru is offensively legal, they can not change the laws they do not control, and they are encouraged to work just so they can pay more in taxes, because the religious gangsters who control the country only care about money, and looking like they give a stone
\medskip
\\Teach about the neurodegenerativity of alcohol, caffeine, and microplastics \fcurve{in food}.
\\Teach about the carcinogenicity of meat, proven by the WHO, and remove it from cafeterias; both, in schools, and in prisons.
\\Teach about the natural disasters caused by meat, and the ethical nature of meat.
\\Teach that pets should be multiplied by twos, or more; if at all.
\\Teach that animals shouldn't be discriminately euthanised, unless pensioners are too; royalty.
\medskip
\\Education is just a societal filter; if all students are not scoring 100\%, then you have failed to educate them!
\medskip
\\Daily peer-reviewed compound testing makes homework redundant, and teachers can teach where it's actually needed:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt, parsep=0pt]
	\item \texttt{teach(addition);} \texttt{test(addition);} \texttt{teach(multiplication);} compounded into a single query \texttt{test(addition, multiplication);}
	\item \texttt{teach(vowels, consonants); test(letters); teach(verbs, nouns,..); test(words);}
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent{}Employees do not get paid for homework!
\\Free time should be decided by the student; they can play, study, work, or outlie, and report self reviews for guidance counselling, and ethical human subject research.
\\By study, I mean study what they want, according to their own interests; their health-based economy could be invested in science kits, and text books.
Students should be encouraged to show off at \textit{Show, And Tell}.
\medskip
\\Encourage students to report their parents to child services for abusing their health-based economy; or make it an online service only accessible from school through teacher supervision.
\\Discounted toys, sporting equipment, clothing, video games, science kits, text books, stationary inanimate objects,..
\\Make it all custom, and unsellable.

\subsection{Horrible Histories}

\subsubsection{Hindu Numerals}

\noindent{}Hindu numerals are abstract representations of anatomical digits; the letters of mathematical language.\bigskip
\\During HE \shyamof{} 10628, \dbrahmagupta{} invented nothing, which evolved into the set of Hindu numerals most of humanity uses today; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
\bigskip
\\The \dbrahmin{} son of \dchajaka{} used a black dot, as the abstract representation of nothing, in the \dbakhshali{} manuscript; the earliest known usage of nothing.
\bigskip
\\The concept of nothingness is a dependency for oneness; if you do not know nothing, then what do you know?

\subsubsection{Hindu Numbers}

\noindent{}Hindu numbers are abstract structures formed by the atomic bonding of Hindu numerals, within a dimensional base.
\bigskip
\\The inventor of the basal Hindu number system of place values is in dispute; \daryabhata{} used it during HE \shyamof{} (10476, 10550], while the \dbrahmin{} son of \dchajaka{} used it in the \dbakhshali{} manuscript; partially carbon dated during HE \shyamof{} [10224, 10383], and HE \shyamof{} [10885, 10993], using inconsistent isotopes.

\subsubsection{Persian Algebra}

\noindent{}Persian algebras are abstract interactions formed by the physical laws of Hindu numbers.
\bigskip
\\During HE \shyamof{} (10780, 10850], \pal{} invented the ability to mathematically describe generalisations.

\subsubsection{Persian Algorithms}

\noindent{}Persian algorithms are just ordered lists of instructions; this can be obscured by people who are too cute for their own good.
\bigskip
\\During HE \shyamof{} (10780, 10850], \pal{} invented the dependency for repeatable experiments; n-person sanity checking improved n-party scientific collaboration.

\subsubsection{Fraudulent Fibonacci, And Lying Lovelace}

\noindent{}During HE \shyamof{} 11202, Leonardo Bigollo Bonacci fibbed; he plagiarised a Hindu integer sequence, invented during HE \shyamof{} [10501, 10600]!
\bigskip
\\This is like attributing Ada Lovelace as the first programmer, even though Charles Babbage KH FRS must have tested his design before applying for funding to implement it!
\bigskip
\\Ada Lovelace commented that Hindu numbers could be used to represent innumerate concepts, but the Pythagoreans were mathematical musicians, and \pal{}' Persian algebra has been applied to innumerate concepts, and before Hindu numerals were invented; they used positional letters of the alphabet to represent Hindu numerate concepts!
\bigskip
\\Musical algorithms, and programs, probably predate mathematical, and computational, algorithms, and programs!% the romans were programming tablets; but i don't know how historically reliable asterix, and obelix, are

\subsection{A Defining Point}

\subsubsection{Identify Yourself}

\noindent{}The identity.
$$f(x) = x$$

\noindent{}Nothing is cumulating the identity.
$$f(x) = f(x + 0)$$

\noindent{}One is accumulating the identity.
$$f(x) = f(x × 1)$$

\noindent{}One is fracturing the identity.
$$f(x) = f(x ÷ 1)$$

\noindent{}One is powering the identity.
$$f(x) = f(x ↑ 1)$$

\noindent{}One is rooting the identity.
$$f(x) = f(\sqrt[1]{x})$$

\noindent{}It appears one identity is more common than n\fcurve{ot}one.

\subsubsection{Geometry Versus Identity}
\begin{align*}
  \sqrt[3]{x} ↑ 3 = \sqrt[3]{x ↑ 3} &= x
\\\sqrt[2]{x} ↑ 2 = \sqrt[2]{x ↑ 2} &= x
\\\sqrt[1]{x} ↑ 1 = \sqrt[1]{x ↑ 1} &= x
\\\sqrt[0]{x} ↑ 0 = \sqrt[0]{x ↑ 0} &= x \veebar 1 \oplus 0
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
  \sqrt[3]{x} &=\text{ an edge of a cube}
\\\sqrt[2]{x} &=\text{ a side of a square}
\\\sqrt[1]{x} &=\text{ a line segment}
\\\sqrt[0]{x} &=\text{ 1 single point }
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
  x ↑ 3 &=\text{ a cube}
\\x ↑ 2 &=\text{ a square}
\\x ↑ 1 &=\text{ a line segment}
\\x ↑ 0 &=\text{ 1 single point }
\end{align*}
$$0 ↑ (x + [x = 0]) = 0 ∵ 0 × 0 = 0$$
$$x ↑ 0 = 1 ∵ \text{1 is the identity of multiplication}$$
\begin{align*}
  3 ↑ 0 &= 1 ∵ 1 × 3 ≠ 1 ∴ 1 × 3 = 3
\\2 ↑ 0 &= 1 ∵ 1 × 2 ≠ 1 ∴ 1 × 2 = 2
\\1 ↑ 0 &= 1 ∵ 1 × 1 = 1 ∴ 1 × 1 = 1
\\0 ↑ 0 &= 1 ∵ 1 × 0 ≠ 1 ∴ 1 × 0 = 0
\end{align*}

\noindent{}¿In the \textit{Flatland} dimension, they have \texttt{/zero|one/} thickness in the higher dimensions?
%`/ = open r-expression
%/` = close r-expression
%`/ `/ /` /` = nested r-expressions
\medskip
\\Conceivably, nothing can exist in a dimension!
\medskip
\\$x ↑ 0$ could be redefined to 0; otherwise, points defined by $x ↑ 0 = 1$ \texttt{/could|should/} be rendered as a $\{0.5,1.5\}$ box, or unit circle, when graphing $(1,1)$.

\subsubsection{Consistency Is A Virtue}
\begin{align*}
  0 ↑ x &= 0
\\x ↑ 0 &= 0
\\1 ↑ x &= 1\text{, where }x ≠ 0
\\x ↑ 1 &= x
\\\sqrt[x]{0} &= 0
\\\sqrt[0]{x} &= 0
\\|\sqrt[x]{1}| &= 1\text{, where }x ≠ 0
\\\sqrt[1]{x} &= x
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
  0 ↑ x &= 0\text{, where }x ≠ 0
\\x ↑ 0 &= 1\fsh{\text{, where }x ≠ 0}
\\1 ↑ x &= 1
\\x ↑ 1 &= x
\\\sqrt[x]{0} &= 0\text{, where }x ≠ 0
\\\sqrt[0]{x} &= 1\fsh{\text{, where }x ≠ 0}
\\|\sqrt[x]{1}| &= 1
\\\sqrt[1]{x} &= x
\end{align*}

\subsection{Unitary Fractures Of United Unary Units}
\begin{align*}
  0.1_{10} &= (1÷10)_{10}
\\0.1_{02} &= (1÷2)_{10}
\\1.1_{01} &= (1 + 1÷1)_{01} = 11_{01} = 2_{10}
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
  0.10_{10} &= (10÷100)_{10} = (1÷10)_{10}
\\0.01_{10} &= (01÷100)_{10}
\\0.11_{10} &= (11÷100)_{10}
\\0.11_{02} &= (3÷4)_{10}
\\0.10_{02} &= (2÷4)_{10} = (1÷2)_{10}
\\0.01_{02} &= (1÷4)_{10}
\\1.11_{01} &= (1 + 11÷11)_{01} = (1 + 1)_{01} = 11_{01} = 2_{10}
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
  (11 - 1)_{01} &= 1_{01}
\\(11.11 - 1.1)_{01} &= 1_{01}
\\(3 - 2)_{10} &= 1_{01}
\end{align*}

\noindent{}Decimating $1_{01}$ serves no purpose!
\\Fracturing $1_{01}$ is the only way!
$$(1÷11)_{01} = (1÷2)_{10}$$

\noindent{}Base 1 is exceptional!

\subsection{Nature Versus Nurture}

\subsubsection{Baseless Accusations}

\noindent{}There are $n$ Hindu numerical representations in base $n$, excluding $n$; which is $10_n$ in all bases, except for $n≤1$.
\begin{align*}
  \text{Base }16 &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,\text{A,B,C,D,E,F}\}
\\\text{Base }15 &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,\text{A,B,C,D,E}\}
\\\text{Base }14 &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,\text{A,B,C,D}\}
\\\text{Base }13 &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,\text{A,B,C}\}
\\\text{Base }12 &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,\text{A,B}\}
\\\text{Base }11 &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,\text{A}\}
\\\text{Base }10 &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}
\\\text{Base }09 &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}
\\\text{Base }08 &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}
\\\text{Base }07 &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}
\\\text{Base }06 &= \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}
\\\text{Base }05 &= \{0,1,2,3,4\}
\\\text{Base }04 &= \{0,1,2,3\}
\\\text{Base }03 &= \{0,1,2\}
\\\text{Base }02 &= \{0,1\}
\\\text{Base }01 &= \{0\}
\\\text{Base }00 &= \{\}
\end{align*}

\noindent{}Since only having zeros is completely useless for anything except for zero itself; we compromise by breaking the rules!
\begin{align*}
  \text{Base }01 &≠ \{0\}
\\\text{Base }01 &= \{1\}
\\\text{Base }00 &= \{0\} = \{\}
\end{align*}

\noindent{}Mathematics is exceptional!

\subsubsection{Nothing Is Natural}

\noindent{}Functions empower the possibility of more complicated Hindu numbers; starting with nothing, and ending with nounderstanding.
\begin{align*}
  0 &= \{\}
\\ℕ &= \{+,×\}
\\ℤ &= \{-,∓,±\}
\\ℚ &= \{÷\}
\\ℝ &= \{\sqrt{},∞\}
\\ℂ &= \{\sqrt[2]{-1}\}
\end{align*}

\noindent{}Nothing introduces nothing.
\bigskip
\\Signage signifies nature, as a signature; but nothing is superpositionally significant.
\\Counting accumulates from nothing.
\bigskip
\\The first position in a list is one, unless the list lists nothing; the only reason why anachronistic programming languages use nothing to address the first position in a list, is because once upon a time, computational resources were so expensively minimal, that the extraposition was worth it; waste not, want not!
\bigskip
\\The concept of nothingness is a dependency for oneness; if you do not know nothing, then what do you know?

\subsection{The Hindu Number Circle Of Reality}

\subsubsection{Archaeology 1}

\noindent{}During HE \shyamof{} 12015 \shyamof{} 06 \shyamof{} 15 \shyamof{} 11 \shyamof{} 41, my Uncle Huggie emailed \fquote{using latin is fine if you are communicating to friends, otherwise you will sound like a wanker. Obsessing about points of little importance and rambling, sending out every thought bubble will make you sound like a lunatic.}.

\subsubsection{Archaeology 2}

\noindent{}The first time I shared my discovery of \dshyam{} was during HE \shyamof{} 12015 \shyamof{} 07 \shyamof{} 06 \shyamof{} 13 \shyamof{} 25, when I posted it to the student forums of my very first mathematical subject for my bachelors; but the course coordinator edited out my proof, leaving behind \fquote{&lt;Material about `dividing by zero' has been removed by a moderator.&gt;}, after another student challenged my claim to fame, and responding \fquote{At the risk of being superfluous in this crowded discussion: You are correct. There is no safe way to divide by zero, and it is best avoided. Your comments about limits are also apt. I have edited Shyam's post to remove the `division by zero' discussion.}.
\bigskip
\\I also replied to my post during HE \shyamof{} 12015 \shyamof{} 07 \shyamof{} 06 \shyamof{} 14 \shyamof{} 22.
$$x^{\frac{n}{d}} = \sqrt[\frac{d}{n}]{x} = \sqrt[d]{x^n}$$

\noindent{}I then made a new thread during HE \shyamof{} 12015 \shyamof{} 07 \shyamof{} 14 \shyamof{} 11 \shyamof{} 37, titled \fquote{Safely Dividing By Zero}; \fquote{These demonstrate expressions containing zero divisions with known answers; the evidence is clear as daylight that they can exist.}.
$$\sqrt[\frac{y}{0}]{x} = x^{\frac{0}{y}} = x^0 = 1$$
$$x\div\frac{y}{0} = x\times\frac{0}{y} = x\times0 = 0$$

\noindent{}And nobody replied.
\\I never let it go.

\noindent{}During HE \shyamof{} 12015 \shyamof{} 09 \shyamof{} 24 \shyamof{} 14 \shyamof{} 11 \shyamof{} 03, my Uncle Huggie emailed \fquote{Apologises if I appear not to be reading what you are saying, I don’t have much time to devote to this as I have been replying in between doing work. As I said earlier, it has been too long since I studied maths and have forgotten most of what I learnt and I don’t have time to back and research the topics to jog my memory.}.

\subsubsection{Archaeology 4}

\noindent{}During HE \shyamof{} 12016 \shyamof{} 03 \shyamof{} 20 \shyamof{} 00 \shyamof{} 32, I emailed my proof to a famous mathematician upon request, subjected \fquote{Warning: Algebra Required!}; who responded \fquote{That is a really good point.

\\$f(\dshyam{})=1$, which means recursively halving even \dshyam{} will return an even number, until $x = 2$; as proven by the recursive application of the graph-theoretic even assumption, and what is known about geometric principles, and symmetries of the universe.
$$f(x) = f(x ÷ 2) × [x = 2 × ⌈y⌉] + x × [x = 2 × ⌊y⌋ - 1]$$

\noindent{}\textbf{\textit{\dshyam{} Space: The Final Frontier.}}
\\\textit{These are the voyages of the starship Little Teapot.}
\\\textit{Its' \dshyam{}-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life, and new civilizations; to boldly go where no man has gone before.}
\bigskip
\\\dshyam{} space occupies all regions of the Hindu number circle of reality, including infinitesimals, wherever the Hindu numbers can only be discovered using a fixed-point; known only as \dshyam{}.
\begin{align*}%WTF
[\dshyam{} ÷ +2&, \dshyam{} ÷ -2]\\
[\dshyam{} ÷ +4&, \dshyam{} ÷ -4]\\
[\dshyam{} ÷ +8&, \dshyam{} ÷ -8]\\

\\(\dshyam{} ÷ (\dshyam{} ÷ -8)&, \dshyam{} ÷ (\dshyam{} ÷ +8))
\\(\dshyam{} ÷ (\dshyam{} ÷ -4)&, \dshyam{} ÷ (\dshyam{} ÷ +4))
\\(\dshyam{} ÷ (\dshyam{} ÷ -2)&, \dshyam{} ÷ (\dshyam{} ÷ +2))
\end{align*}

\noindent{}The circumference of the Hindu number circle of reality is $\dshyam{} × 2 = 0$.
\\The diameter of the Hindu number circle of reality is $2 × (\dshyam{} ÷ \pi) ≠ 0$.
\\The radius of the Hindu number circle of reality is $\dshyam{} ÷ \pi$.
\\The area of the Hindu number circle of reality is $\pi × ((\dshyam{} ÷ \pi) ↑ 2)$.
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\begin{align}
C &= 2 × \pi × r
\\\dshyam{} × 2 &= 2 × \pi × r
\\\dshyam{} &= \pi × r
\\\dshyam{} ÷ \pi &= r
\\\dshyam{} ÷ \pi &= \dshyam{} ÷ \pi
\\\dshyam{} &= \dshyam{}
\\…∞… &= …∞…
\\+([0, \dshyam{}]) &= -1 ÷ 12
\\-([0, \dshyam{}]) &= +1 ÷ 12
\\+(-([0, \dshyam{}]),+([0, \dshyam{}])) &= (-1 ÷ 12) + (+1 ÷ 12) = 0
\end{align}

\noindent{}The $0^{\text{th}}$ dimension is a real point of singularity, on a real unit line segment in the $1^{\text{st}}$ dimension.
\\The $1^{\text{st}}$ dimension is a real unit line segment, on the Hindu number circle of reality in the $2^{\text{nd}}$ dimension.
\\The $2^{\text{nd}}$ dimension is the Hindu number circle of reality, on the graphical Hindu number sphere of reality in the $3^{\text{rd}}$ dimension.
\\And recurse on…
\bigskip
\\The Hindu number sphere of reality is such that $(1, \dshyam{}) = (\dshyam + 1, 0)$.
\bigskip
\\Continuing on from the graphical face of the $3^{\text{rd}}$ dimensional Hindu number sphere of reality, imagines \dshyam{} intersectional lines bilocationally vectoring off towards the core of ∞, and the borders of the universal set; but they never meet at the core of ∞, since they circulate around to their othersides, whilst crossing the border of the universal set through the $4^{\text{th}}$ dimension.
\bigskip
\\All these topological structures, formed by the atomic bonding of points, are topical.
\bigskip
\\Infinites are contextually different, based on their higher dimensional vectors.
\bigskip
\\Nothing is a fixed-point, from which we walk in \hadd{} additive, and \hsub{} subtractive, directions; as Egyptians \hdance{} pharaonic dance with continuity along the Hindu number \fstrike{circle} sphere of reality; as honey bees $0$ round dance, and $8$ waggle dance, along trips down memory lanes.

No, no; you need to slide it sideways, otherwise it's locked! Or maybe you just do not possess the muscular strength to perform this Herculean task! It may also be automated; using a button, swipe card, gesture, or just your mere presence, unless the power is out, or it's broken.

\bigskip
\\\fcurve{Hindus don't use war to convert, unlike the Crusades, \hmilkhemetmitzvah{}, and ISIS; Jamma Maaples only exist because the Muslims invaded, and used psychological manipulation on them during their captivity; any religion that spreads through bruteforce has no density, and is of no interest to me.}% had hindus not been so benevolent, muslims would no longer exist; instead they were allowed to become backstabbers #in_my_country_there_is_problem

\\\fcurve{Hindus who are born into Hinduism were \ddeva{} in their previous life $∴$ I was a \ddeva{} in my previous life. Rastafaris put someone else on a pedestal; who wasn't even Jamaican, and didn't even convert, although its' obvious they used him as an excuse to get high; Christianity was forced upon them, and they just used it to abuse loopholes in the law; playing by someone elses rules, and beating them at their own game. Christians put someone else on a pedestal; but they don't follow that persons' religion; probably due to mockery, where \hmoses{} split the Red Sea to save his people, and \hjesus{} just died on a cross even though he could've done more if he became the healing Jesus Cæsar of the Roman Empire instead of not being saved by anyone who witnessed his crucifixion. Semites put themselves on a pedestal, but not their followers; the only reason I can come up with for the antisemitisim in \textit{Agora} \fcurve{HE \shyamof{} 12009}, is that they, as groups, validated discriminatory religions that gave them preferential treatment; I'm neutral with their existence, and beliefs, but if they want me to play their game, then I'll be antisemetic as well, unless they want to play mine, in which case I claim to be God, therefore all must worship me, and I commandeth that all other claims are invalidated, Hinduism is the one true religion, which means Gods can die, you goto Hell if you kill me, as I previously commandethed, and you all have to stick with Hinduism even after I reincarnate.}% well, hindus who are born of hindus, who are born of hindus, who are born of hindus; which \ddeva{} would pray to be born into a family of sin? if you change your religion even once; which \ddeva{} would pray to be born into a family of undecidability? which \ddeva{} would pray to be born into a family raised by a family of sin, and undecidability? but you should be focused on your own \dkarma{} anyway
\bigskip
\\\fcurve{Hindus consider all \dmahadeva{}, according to all religions, to be one, and the same; but Atheism is sinfully offensive to the \ddeva{}. About a decade ago, I used to respect Atheists; thinking them intelligent, rational, and reasonable. But I was never one myself. I began to observe inconsistencies, and holes in their logic; you cannot put God in a box, where you make the rules, win, and claim any density. I think it all started while I was watching \textit{The Amazing Randi}, who routinely proves the longevity claims of safe medicine by failing to overdose on homeopathy, and at the end of the stage show, the host, and he, are sitting on a couch during Q\&A; this guy walks up to the podium, and starts saying how he is offended by his friends who tell him that they pray for him; being offend by someone elses' thoughts, this is when I realised that all groups have \dpagala{}. \textit{Religulous} \fcurve{HE \shyamof{} 12008} featured three fawlty facts about Hinduism; revealing Atheistic ignorance, presented by a jester. Atheists basically just followed the one religion they were born into, and then spontaneously decide God doesn't exist; without any evidence, nor explanation for life, the multiverse, and everything. It's not like there are unbiased research papers on all mainstream religions; outlining objective proclamations, and subjective contradictions; one would have to learn the original languages to use as a fixed-point for the cross-examination of misinterpretations from all translations, while also considering cases like the compromised integrity of the \dmanusmriti{}; the British are to blame for everything! My ideal Atheist is one who studies all religions; like Beni Gabor, from \textit{The Mummy} \fcurve{HE \shyamof{} 11999}; for Hinduism, all you need to do is chant the mahā-mantra 35,000,000 times, before your \datma{} leaves the body it occupies; you can do it in half a decade; you can also read the 700 verses of the \dgita{} in a day. It's like car insurance; you don't think you need it, and you aren't aware of your photosensitive epilepsy; one day you're driving under trees, with the sun dancing through the leaves… Considering a truth table, zero-sum game, decision table, decision tree, or whatever; Theists, and Atheists, horizontally; Heaven \& Hell, and Eternal Oblivion, vertically; Theists are at $+1$ for Heaven \& Hell, while Atheists are $-1$; both are $0$ for Eternal Oblivion; even though Atheists are right, they do not get anything out of it; the sums are $0+1$ for Theists, and $0-1$ for Atheists.}
\newpage
\noindent{}\fcurve{Hindus have personal relationships with God; Hindus know who God is! Russells' teapot only exists because of Abrahamic religions, claiming a teapot is in the Heavens; not knowing where the teapot is, what the teapot looks like, the dimensions of the teapot, the type of the teapot, the sound the teapot makes when it shouts from getting all steamed up, nor any other features of the teapot. If you love someone, and you cannot be with them; you hold their image dearly, and think of their features; otherwise you risk forgetting to remember them; who they are, and not just what you think of them. Abrahamic religions don't know who, nor what, God even is; they are religions without God, and spread through bruteforce. God rewards, while the Devil punishes; attacking infidels is the work of the Devil, according to their own religions. Abrahamic religions don't know anything about their God; the one they supposedly worship; they aren't allowed to know about God; God is as forbidden as the forbidden fruit. Abrahamic religions instead worship prophets; Satan incarnate. Arabic Polytheists once exclaimed the unoriginal ``\aallahuakbar{}''; then \amuhammad{} stole it, and went on a killing spree because he was mocked by those who used it first, as Hitler was most likely mistreated by other Jews while he was imprisoned. ``H\underline{alle}lujah!''; we just aren't allowed to know anything about God. I'm surprised they're even allowed to know the names of prophets, in such so-called ``religions'' of suppressive ignorance; where God cannot be understood, but impersonal praise be to the impersonification of Gods, and prophets, who you aren't even allowed to imagine, nor dream of, in your mind; this is ``blind faith''. Do you even religion?}% how many limbs do your gods, and prophets, have? you must not know, or goto hell! do your gods, and  prophets, have a mouth, eyes, and other such features? you must not know, or goto hell! what gender are your gods, and prophets? you must not know, or goto hell! (i dreamt of god!) what did god look like? what did god sound like? (just praise "god"; who ever "god" is; even if "god" is the devil; in a religion where you don't really have to do anything to get into "heaven"; even though "heaven" is hell) i can say \amuhammad{} was not a man, and it is the truth according to their own religion; or they goto hell
\bigskip
\\\fcurve{Sanskrit is as formal as natural languages get, and Hinduism is as formal as religions get. Our holy wars are philosophical debates concerning the Vedas; there was even a duel, where the father lost his life, and, many years later, the son was victorious; I think he allowed his fathers killer to live in dishonour; a fate worse than death! Most debates result in the loser accepting the winner as their \dguru{}, or something. Neuroscientists recently discovered \textit{The Sanskrit Effect}; what other religion can claim to be good for your mind, body, and \datma{}? Given the carcinogenicity of meat, and the body of knowledge related to God.}% the dishonoured cannot goto the heavenly planets; thus, securing their fate
\bigskip
\\\fcurve{The war in the \dmahabharata{} was an internal affair; both sides followed the same religion. Hindus do not force others to follow their religion; Hindus do not even proselytise; you won't find some \dpagala{} on the street yelling in Hindu tongues; there are just too many different Gods; you worship whichever God you want; Gods of weather, wealth, health, fortune, war, education, entertainment, family, psychology, and anything else that exists; you just visit the temples you're interested in, depending on your goals in life, the multiverse, and everything. Religion is a personal journey, guided by a \dguru{}, where only the Gods are fit to judge such matters; Hindus respect all Gods, of all religions. Hindus just leave it up to your \dkarma{} to decide your spirituality; basically, you're on your own, unless you beg a \dguru{} to do what they can to save your \datma{}, or whatever your goals are in life, the multiverse, and everything.}
\bigskip
\\\fcurve{Hindus will be hunted by meat-eaters; Hindus by this time ``will be so unique in character, and peculiar compared with the rest of society, that they will be ridiculed, and hunted down in the cities for sport like animals''. Your existence is defined by Hinduism; your existence is \drakshasa{}, lower than \dchandala{}; \textit{Yama-dūtas, Yama-dūtas! Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do, when they come for you? Yama-dūtas, Yama-dūtas!}}% muslims cannot condemn the actions of their prophet \amuhammad{}, for if they do; they are condemning the actions of the messenger from God, thus they are condemning their very own God; therefore, they would goto Hell, as according to their own designed ``religion''

\subsection{I Need An Adult}

\noindent{}I have an imagination complex:(
\bigskip
\\Mathematics is a language, which can be \fcurve{ab}used to explain, or describe, anything!
$$-1 ≠ \sqrt[2]{-1} ↑ 2 ≠ \sqrt[2]{(-1) ↑ 2} = (-1) ↑ 2 = +1 = (+1) ↑ 2$$

\noindent{}Just because something appears to work, doesn't mean it works how you think it works!!
$$x ↑ 2 ≠ (-1) × (+1)$$

\noindent{}There is no need for $i()$ to be nesciently defined in terms of unreal Hindu numbers, to derive an applied pattern; I've merely debated the omnipotent exponent into submission, without your assistance, since it took so long for you to arrive here!!!
% \fcurve{ab}using ∞ requires \dshyam{} multiplication starting from halfway
%$$i(x) = -1 × [x = 2 × ⌈y⌉] + 2 × [x = 4 × ⌊y⌋] + (\dshyam{} ÷ 2) × [x = 2 × ⌈y⌉ - 1]$$
%
% use \dshyam{} as much as possible
%$$i(x) = -1 × [x = 2 × ⌈y⌉] + 2 × [x = 4 × ⌊y⌋] + (\dshyam{} ↑ 2) × [x = 2 × ⌈y⌉ - 1]$$
%
%$$i(x) = -1 × [x = 2 × ⌈y⌉] + 2 × [x = 4 × ⌊y⌋] + (\dshyam{} ↑ \dshyam{}) × [x = 2 × ⌈y⌉ - 1]$$
%
%$$i(x) = -1 × [x = 2 × ⌈y⌉] + 2 × [x = 4 × ⌊y⌋] + i() × [x = 2 × ⌈y⌉ - 1]$$
%
% it is still \dshyam{} recursive!
$$i(x) = -1 × [x = 2 × ⌈y⌉] + 2 × [x = 4 × ⌊y⌋] + i(x) × [x = 2 × ⌈y⌉ - 1]$$

\noindent{}Welcome to functional-logical reality:)
