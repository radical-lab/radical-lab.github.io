<pre>
please
specify
a
unique
id
but
the
id
you
designate
must
be
unique
otherwise
you
may
find
yourself
sharing
someone
elses
account
or
overwriting
and
thereby
deleting
someone
elses
account
or
even
worse
as
you
may
break
our
website
and
therefore
effectively
perform
a
distributed
denial
of
service
attack
on
our
servers
which
is
illegal
and
you
will
be
prosecuted
for
malicious
intent
notwithstanding
this
is
a
ministerial
attempt
to
improve
security
since
your
unique
id
will
also
be
used
to
determine
your
password
which
also
means
there
is
only
a
single
authentication
factor
thus
simplifying
your
life
and
the
universe
and
everything
so
now
