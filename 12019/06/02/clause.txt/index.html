as you stand for which I justly accuse
allowing children to die's child abuse
all for the sake of religious chivalry
defending a lawfully supported devilry
you could have prayed every single day
but your child was going to die anyway
you can consider your child to be dead
while we steal your child away instead
to be raised in the righteous hinduism
in an effort to avoid ungodly satanism

raising children is difficult
but don't blame the evil cult
be sure your surety won't lie
when you pray for them to die

faith healing is faith revealing wit
ken in more ways than one, or is it?
