<br>√ Research And Development In Computation And Linguistics - Like A Boss

Logic ∈ Computation
<br>Logic ∈ PELF
<br>Mathematics = Computation
<br>Intelligence ∈ Computation ∪ Linguistics
<br>So, maybe…

√ Research And Development: Intelligence, Computation, And Linguistics - Like A Boss

…and just work my way backwards? I prefer not ∵ symbolic ∧ linguistic instability, and I like the [triple TLAs √rad∈cal-lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU4pyiB-kq0)!!! :D

I've always felt like `…!!! :D` is `Wubba Lubba Dub-Dub` c̄out so many words, but IDK about the undertones; I am in great pain, please help me!

## √ Ever-Changing Plan
* emacs
* elisp
	* `/productivity edit(or|ing) tool/`
		* could probably start the "learning" system since elisp is a commitment
		* and the related "-thing"; these have probably been backed up though … luckily it is mid-way, but only `/learn/` is easily discoverable … there are only theories of what "-thing" actually is ((in)security, study,..), but it is as general as (machine) "learning"
* swipl
* mercury
* lojban
* [hpmor](http://www.hpmor.com/)
	* shyamscript license
	* programming language implementations: virtual machines (generalised src-src compiler), n-ary compiler (optimiser), interactive interpreter (repl; just jit the instructions through the compiler with `/minimal|timed|optimised/` optimisations), scripting interpreter (unix shell scripts; just map the script through the repl, or map the repl over the script), unix shell interpreter (could just perl it, and `/merge|fuse|parasit(e|ism)|cleaner fish/` [unix](https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/cleaner-fish-may-make-other-fish-in-the-sea-smarter/) into the repl)
		* `/√(rules|assumptions|arguments|parameters|falsified realities|kbs|intelligences?|powers?|impossibilities|anomalies|mitigations|linguist|brute|force|jedi|mind|tricks|brain|cellular automata|systems?|logic|flp)/`: self hosted prolog
		* `/√sigmatism/`: [make a lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) in √prolog (lisp machine, compiler, repl, script, [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scsh))
		* `/√pet/`: sigmatic emacs
		* `/√shyamscript/`: shyamscript in √prolog
		* `/√shyamskrit/`: gödelling-inspired [b5-inspired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlac#Babylon_5) `/(auto|pure|numerically programmatic|programmatically numerical|(computational linguistics)?)intelligence/` ([self-answering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autological_word) queries; kbs⊃{bootstrapped,jitted,recursive,[deductive](https://github.com/Shyam-Has-Your-Anomaly-Mitigated/awesome-deduction)}) … maybe just use math instead of shyamskrit, and go c̄ [phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) + [disambiguation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban) + [vegan](https://qz.com/1116991/a-biologist-believes-that-trees-speak-a-language-we-can-learn/)(plant-based) + [sigils](https://indefiniteloop.com/blog/img/posts/06-10-2015/esperanto.png) for shyamskrit ([order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Language_word_order_frequency), and [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system#Directionality), should support free will; may not even require metadata of starting point, nor programmatic reading pattern (`/spirals|hopscotch|.*/`) for `/(artistic|poetic) (expression|articulation)/` c̄ (animated) automatic translation into preferential reading pattern) … [feminist conspiracy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Interlac_Landscape.JPG) … [clicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant), [whistles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistled_language), [tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)), [overtones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtone_singing), [signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language), [face & body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_language) (to say one thing with our mouth, but say another with the `/rhythmic|musical/` timing of our blinking; for example, would make game of thrones seem tame, and could be used for alien telepathy in science fiction)
