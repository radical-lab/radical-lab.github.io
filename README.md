<br>√ Research And Development In Computation And Linguistics - Like A Boss

Logic ∈ Computation
<br>Logic ∈ PELF
<br>Mathematics = Computation
<br>Intelligence ∈ Computation ∪ Linguistics
<br>So, maybe…

√ Research And Development: Intelligence, Computation, And Linguistics - Like A Boss

…and just work my way backwards? I prefer not ∵ symbolic ∧ linguistic instability, and I like the [triple TLAs √rad∈cal-lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU4pyiB-kq0)!!! :D

I've always felt like `…!!! :D` is `Wubba Lubba Dub-Dub` c̄out so many words, but IDK about the undertones; I am in great pain, please help me!
