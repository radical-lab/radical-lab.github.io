## ‚àö Ever-Changing Plan
* [x] HE‚àò12019‚àò08‚àò01À¢·µó: overexspend on bandwidth (twofer)‚ÅΩ·µó ∑·µí·∂†·µâ ≥‚Åæ `/ÍÉî|êÜà/`
* [ ] get degree (maybe in another three months at the second exam attempt; they cancelled enr208 for the foreseeable future, so an alternative minor will have to start all over again if both exams are failures)
* [ ] work for the dole (for <s>about 3 months after the first exam</s> `20-(5+4√∑7)√∑20` weeks)
	* six months each year; this is when i'll study (should have done this to begin with!)
	* every other half a year can be emacs, elisp, swipl, mercury, lojban, [ (Âçê) ],..
* [x] c‚àòmp‚àòse, and then become a lispian on the HE‚àò12019‚àò09‚àò09·µó ∞ (or maybe the HE‚àò12019‚àò09‚àò07·µó ∞)
	* this is a commitment to emacs; i will not use vim (unless i have no choice, for files like vimcrypt; until i get emacs to handle those kinds of files)
* [ ] emacs
	* do i check this now? or after i finish rtfm? after i finish rtfm since it starts from today
	* i will `/spend|invest/` at least an hour per day, every day, rtfm; after i check this, i will `/spend|invest/` less time, every day, rtfm
* [ ] elisp (`/electr(on)?ic lisp/`)
	* i will `/spend|invest/` at least an hour per day, every day, rtfm; after i check this, i will `/spend|invest/` less time, every day, rtfm
	* `/productivity edit(or|ing) tool/`
		* could probably start the "learning" system since elisp is a commitment
		* and the related "-thing"; these have probably been backed up though ‚Ä¶ luckily it is mid-way, but only `/learn/` is easily discoverable ‚Ä¶ there are only theories of what "-thing" actually is ((in)security, study,..), but it is as general as (machine) "learning"
* [ ] reconfigure emacs keybindings; it's easier to rtfm without this

		* programming language implementation is using java to implement c; who needs to do this for [class](http://stevehanov.ca/blog/?id=56)?
		* i doubt i would get a job implementing languages, or operating systems; these are just personal projects for my own sanity
		* alternative electives
			* security
				* formal methods is the best approach to security; first, and foremost
			* optimisation (multithreading, multicoring, multiprocessing, parallel, concurrent, distributed, asychronous,..)
				* formal methods is better than having more bugs faster
				* programming language implementations can automate this; given target resources, and using artificial intelligence
		* potential jobs
			* floss artificial intelligence; what are you hiding? you won't have control over a general intelligence
			* floss formal methods; now that you have no bugs, there's no reason to hide them from the public (even though we know they're a front for illegal activity)
			* floss frontend javascript; this is already floss, you phb!
* [ ] swipl
	* imputation (finance) is an interesting concept for (intelligent) programming; "the assignment of a value to something by inference from the value of the products or processes to which it contributes" sounds like a reverse precomputation, where you need to take a step back before you can take a step forward; the type of the contribution, the algorithm of the contribution, and the context of the contribution, could all be used to help determine the contributions' parameters‚Ä¶sound like prolog to me
