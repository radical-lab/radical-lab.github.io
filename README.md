‚Ä¶and just work my way backwards? I prefer not ‚àµ symbolic ‚àß linguistic instability, and I like the [triple TLAs ‚àörad‚ààcal-lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU4pyiB-kq0)!!! :D

## ‚àö Ever-Changing Plan
* [x] HE‚àò12019‚àò08‚àò01À¢·µó: overexspend on bandwidth (twofer)‚ÅΩ·µó ∑·µí·∂†·µâ ≥‚Åæ `/ÍÉî|êÜà/`
* [ ] get degree (maybe in another three months at the second exam attempt; they cancelled enr208 for the foreseeable future, so an alternative minor will have to start all over again if both exams are failures)
* [ ] work for the dole (for <s>about 3 months after the first exam</s> `20-(5+4√∑7)√∑20` weeks)
	* six months each year; this is when i'll study (should have done this to begin with!)
	* every other half a year can be emacs, elisp, swipl, mercury, lojban, [ (Âçê) ],..
* [x] c‚àòmp‚àòse, and then become a lispian on the HE‚àò12019‚àò09‚àò09·µó ∞ (or maybe the HE‚àò12019‚àò09‚àò07·µó ∞)
	* this is a commitment to emacs; i will not use vim (unless i have no choice, for files like vimcrypt; until i get emacs to handle those kinds of files)
* [ ] emacs
	* do i check this now? or after i finish rtfm? after i finish rtfm since it starts from today
	* i will `/spend|invest/` at least an hour per day, every day, rtfm; after i check this, i will `/spend|invest/` less time, every day, rtfm
* [ ] elisp (`/electr(on)?ic lisp/`)
	* i will `/spend|invest/` at least an hour per day, every day, rtfm; after i check this, i will `/spend|invest/` less time, every day, rtfm
	* `/productivity edit(or|ing) tool/`
		* could probably start the "learning" system since elisp is a commitment
		* and the related "-thing"; these have probably been backed up though ‚Ä¶ luckily it is mid-way, but only `/learn/` is easily discoverable ‚Ä¶ there are only theories of what "-thing" actually is ((in)security, study,..), but it is as general as (machine) "learning"
* [ ] reconfigure emacs keybindings; it's easier to rtfm without this

		* programming language implementation is using java to implement c; who needs to do this for [class](http://stevehanov.ca/blog/?id=56)?
		* i doubt i would get a job implementing languages, or operating systems; these are just personal projects for my own sanity
		* alternative electives
			* security
				* formal methods is the best approach to security; first, and foremost
			* optimisation (multithreading, multicoring, multiprocessing, parallel, concurrent, distributed, asychronous,..)
				* formal methods is better than having more bugs faster
				* programming language implementations can automate this; given target resources, and using artificial intelligence
		* potential jobs
			* floss artificial intelligence; what are you hiding? you won't have control over a general intelligence
			* floss formal methods; now that you have no bugs, there's no reason to hide them from the public (even though we know they're a front for illegal activity)
			* floss frontend javascript; this is already floss, you phb!
* [ ] swipl
	* imputation (finance) is an interesting concept for (intelligent) programming; "the assignment of a value to something by inference from the value of the products or processes to which it contributes" sounds like a reverse precomputation, where you need to take a step back before you can take a step forward; the type of the contribution, the algorithm of the contribution, and the context of the contribution, could all be used to help determine the contributions' parameters‚Ä¶sound like prolog to me

* [x] drink (vegan, recyclable; organic milk + sugar (pinch the microplastic bag opening, and pour through the hole; no need for a cloggy funnel,..); filtered tap water)
* [x] jalape√±o-stuffed olives (vegan, recyclable; i eat these by the jar when i am just way too lazy to effortuously cook, nor even laboriously prepare bread; i do like me a hot crossed b-girl who can really spread her breads like ty lee (kaylee is also a valleygirl; right? amy wong too; right? rebooty boomer as well; right? and mary ann? post-modern(femin)ism; right? i really need to learn varma kalai, dim mak, carotid compression, brain stem deoxygenation,..))

is it possible to have redundancy systems?
i think i need to forget about electronics, and go for parallel distributed computing; like raid for backup, over capacity‚Ä¶
who needs speed? i just want fault tolerance!

the cancers of society: i'm going to reattach their intestines, and urethras, to their throats; i will leave their tongues, but ply out their teeth; one, by one, slowly, so ever slowly; i will take my /bitter|sweet/ time; i will rip their faces open like n·πõsi·πÅha to make it easier to access their teeth; i will box their personalities; they will feel pain until they die; that will never happen if i /reverse|pause/ their aging process; they will only ever /see|hear/ me to remind them why; i will put them in chastity belts, and inject viagra; i will force feed them down their noses; i will force breath them down their noses; i will cyber their hearts; they will not die ‚àµ dying is not good enough; s/i/they/ will cure neurodegeneration; they will slave;..
a labotomy could probably enhance pain receptors

my theory is that neurodegenerates just don't use their brains (/in certain ways|the airheads probably just sit there doing nothing while their sanity drifts away unweighted by any density (this is what i imagine all other humans actually do irl)?/); i have subjected myself to personal experiences to support it, and i /(sus|ex)pect/ most people are where i am now; i will recover ‚àµ my experiential theories just make sense; but, before i begin, i need to wait until i can get an openbci, microphones, cameras (eye-tracking pov, 1À¢·µó person pov, 3 ≥·µà person pov),.; the goal sates ascension, but big data is a dependency; i think it's better to just leave everybody else here in the loop; lock it up, and throw away the key (desynchronisation; the loop is reasonable, ‚àß ‚à¥ can't be trusted cÃÑout supervision; i will leave like a leaf on the wind, watch how i soar)
personality boxes can be therapeutic‚Ä¶

if i ascend at 31; my life will be peaceful, and prosperous
this sates occult research, and secret methods of experimental science; it's all (in) my head, but the openbci is compromised by management engines,..

if i start a bank, i can borrow from myself; i can encourage others to start banks so i can borrow from them, bringing them up to my level, while slingshotting off them to a higher plane (well beyond that of the mile high club) #metameta #mce
they can take a dependent leap of faith, and lend it all for #meta

they can't boycott me ‚àµ i will metatarget them through f(x) trading; or is it f‚Çì trading ‚àò (higher order) currency pairs? f‚Çì(B,S). % does swipl support unicode functors?

twin towers was a 911 ddos, fight club,.. (terrorists would target mount rushmore, the statue of liberty,.; much easier than orchestrating planes, which is more like a moon landing; as easy as the geometry involved cÃÑ launching missiles at your own /10|20/ trillion dollar militarys' pentagonal headquarters; flossed formal methods are superior to whatever /dysfunctional|illogical/ languages they use (for tacamo, milstar, nuclear football,.; they don't just let just anyone win the elections, or mexico would be a "-thing" of the past); probably /cobol|java/ since it's popular amongst the evil business people who control the big bad corporations)

leaders are vulnerable to man in the middle attacks; by humans, aliens, aliens,.. #truman

i just discovered interdimensional travel to alternate realities; based on an old theory from when i was young, and naive; as related to the jumper theory, but includes planetary alignment; the moon is significant, the sun is probably significant, but it can be done from earth; a lock can be placed to block it though; really easily; there is a chance it's already blocked; it's more than likely; this would require international cooperation; never going to happen; elon musks' satellite network could be repurposed to break the lock (but this is counterintuitive since it most likely reinforces it); or just move the moon; assuming its' speed is variable depending on its' relative distance to earth; it makes sense for it to cycle its' directional orientation; drifts away, drifts closer; like a life sign; where was i? is it the moon moving, or the earth, or both? i was phaseshifting in between the harmonic vibrational frequencies to rip a hole through spacetime to really stone humanity while i transcend this existence using their annihilation to slingshot me to catch the higher plane (of existence); they all deserve it anyway
either that, or elon musk is locking it, and it was never locked, but it could be cÃÑout elon musk; this is based on the theory that locking it is either impractical (/unlikely|improbable/), or it is already being used #network_topological_quasiisometry

i want to do websites like this; avoiding the browser features
