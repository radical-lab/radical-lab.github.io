<br>√ Research And Development In Computation And Linguistics - Like A Boss

Logic ∈ Computation
<br>Logic ∈ PELF
<br>Mathematics = Computation
<br>Intelligence ∈ Computation ∪ Linguistics
<br>So, maybe…

√ Research And Development: Intelligence, Computation, And Linguistics - Like A Boss

…and just work my way backwards? I prefer not ∵ symbolic ∧ linguistic instability, and I like the [triple TLAs √rad∈cal-lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU4pyiB-kq0)!!! :D

I've always felt like `…!!! :D` is `Wubba Lubba Dub-Dub` c̄out so many words, but IDK about the undertones; I am in great pain, please help me!

## √ Ever-Changing Plan
* emacs
* elisp
	* `/productivity edit(or|ing) tool/`
		* could probably start the "learning" system since elisp is a commitment
		* and the related "-thing"; these have probably been backed up though … luckily it is mid-way, but only `/learn/` is easily discoverable … there are only theories of what "-thing" actually is ((in)security, study,..), but it is as general as (machine) "learning"
* swipl
* mercury
* lojban
* [insuring intelligence](https://intelligence.org/2017/04/12/ensuring/)
	* [googoltalx](https://talksat.withgoogle.com/talk/ensuring-smarter-than-human-intelligence-has-a-positive-outcome)
* [zombies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers#Philosophical_work)
	* [spiderzombies](http://consc.net/zombies-on-the-web/) (what's that song like Ring∘Fire, but "zombies on the web"?)
* [rationality](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationality:_From_AI_to_Zombies)
	* [audiobook](https://from-ai-to-zombies.eu/) (unauthorized fan recording)
	* [textbook](https://www.readthesequences.com/)
	* [ebook](https://intelligence.org/rationality-ai-zombies/)
	* [hpmor](https://intelligence.org/2015/03/12/rationality-ai-zombies/)
* [hpmor](http://www.hpmor.com/)
	* shyamscript license
	* programming language implementations: virtual machines (generalised src-src compiler), n-ary compiler (optimiser), interactive interpreter (repl; just jit the instructions through the compiler with `/minimal|timed|optimised/` optimisations), scripting interpreter (unix shell scripts; just map the script through the repl, or map the repl over the script), unix shell interpreter (could just perl it, and `/merge|fuse|parasit(e|ism)|cleaner fish/` [unix](https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/cleaner-fish-may-make-other-fish-in-the-sea-smarter/) into the repl)
		* `/√(rules|assumptions|arguments|parameters|falsified realities|kbs|intelligences?|powers?|impossibilities|anomalies|mitigations|linguist|brute|force|jedi|mind|tricks|brain|cellular automata|systems?|logic|flp)/`: self hosted prolog
			* f(t,p) :- type checking.
			* f(T,p) :- type inference.
			* f(t,P) :- program synthesis, type inhabitance is the edge identity.
			* f(T,P) :- T, P. % in that order, type inhabitance is the edge identity for P, T is infinite
		* `/√sigmatism/`: [make a lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal) in √prolog (lisp machine, compiler, repl, script, [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scsh))
			* dependently typed, lazily evaluated, (- x y z) = (- 0 x y z) = 0-x-y-z = -(x+y+z) = (- 0 (+ x y z)), (- x y z) versus (- '(x y z)), all you need is the addition of signed Hindu numbers (use the tools you already have, instead of making new ones that're redundant before they even exist)
		* `/√pet/`: sigmatic emacs
		* `/√shyamscript/`: shyamscript in √prolog
		* `/√.*/`: for accessing `shyam://`; supporting √prolog, sigmatism, and shyamscript
			* an opportunity presents itself for intelligent standardisation; boycotting the worst of <s>humanity</s> stupidity
				* one `/image|video|audio/` file.av format to rule them all (dry; technological resources are now permissible, but I'm sure it can be dotadiwed c̄ glue, and version conversion subscriptions…will be automated by the auto versioning server infrastructure to avoid legacy support!!! :D) …`/svg|bitmap/` …`/transparency|gamut/` …svg as f(t)
				* one text encoding system to rule them all (unicode `/su(per|b)sets/`)
				* and in the cyberspace; hack them
		* `/√.*/`: an incompatible operating system that comes with a free pet, and even knows a few languages (both humanable, and computational); incompatibilities can be handled externally to maintain internal purity from the (zombie) horde of humanity
			* shyam time starts from my birthplace (including `/elevation|altitude/`) during my birthday (not midnight); s is the time it takes for a `/hammer|feather|.*/` to fall 1m in a vacuum (draw 1m in the air to count 1s; mathematical counting for the purposes of time keeping is now an healthy exercise); s "seconds" in an earthly rotation versus degrees versus percentages (variable rotational durations means degrees, and percentages, are more favourable); d earthly rotations in a solar year versus degrees versus percentages (variable rotations means degrees, and percentages, are more favourable), where south-up mapping means clockwise day-night indicators like my phones battery indicator (night is down, day is up); y solar years in a galactic orbit versus degrees versus percentages (variable years means degrees, and percentages, are more favourable), starting from shyam time; SHYAM \y ∘ \d ∘ \s
				* <s>since it's the planets who are named after the Roman Pantheon, and not the months, it's not offending the gods by not using them</s>; Janus, Februa, Mars, Venus, Bona Dea, Juno, Julius Cæsar, Augustus Cæsar, <s>7ᵗʰ</s> 9ᵗʰ September, <s>8ᵗʰ</s> 10ᵗʰ October, <s>9ᵗʰ</s> 11ᵗʰ November, <s>10ᵗʰ</s> 12ᵗʰ December
				* IT'S MARKET DAY!!! work-days versus free-days can be `/customised|tailored/` instead; not everyone lives consistent c̄ "royal" stupidity (garbage in, garbage out)
		* `/√shyamskrit/`: gödelling-inspired [b5-inspired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlac#Babylon_5) `/(auto|pure|numerically programmatic|programmatically numerical|(computational linguistics)?)intelligence/` ([self-answering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autological_word) queries; kbs⊃{bootstrapped,jitted,recursive,[deductive](https://github.com/Shyam-Has-Your-Anomaly-Mitigated/awesome-deduction)}) … maybe just use math instead of shyamskrit, and go c̄ [phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) + [disambiguation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban) + [vegan](https://qz.com/1116991/a-biologist-believes-that-trees-speak-a-language-we-can-learn/)(plant-based) + [sigils](https://indefiniteloop.com/blog/img/posts/06-10-2015/esperanto.png) for shyamskrit ([order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Language_word_order_frequency), and [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system#Directionality), should support free will; may not even require metadata of starting point, nor programmatic reading pattern (`/spirals|hopscotch|.*/`) for `/(artistic|poetic) (expression|articulation)/` c̄ (animated) automatic translation into preferential reading pattern) … [feminist conspiracy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Interlac_Landscape.JPG) … [clicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant), [whistles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistled_language), [tones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)), [overtones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtone_singing), [signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_language), [face & body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_language) (to say one thing with our mouth, but say another with the `/rhythmic|musical/` timing of our blinking; for example, would make game of thrones seem tame, and could be used for alien telepathy in science fiction) … no politically litigious gender pronouns; either, use their name, or `/they|them|their|me|my|i/` … no dialectal pronounciation; potatoes are botanically classified as vegetables, whilst tomatoes are botanically classified as fruit, even if an idiocratic (12006) usa judge `/nesciently|analphabetically|unletteredly|illiterately/` considered them vegetables all for the sake of taxation purposes (for some reason they taxed vegetables, but not fruit because it's `/politically|litigiously/` gay) … https://youtu.be/_UqxSq19_Aw
