: any"-thing" that takes /inputs?/ can be turing complete; `id(X,X), =(X,"turing complete system").`; personality box rewrites; natural language comments ÷ turing complete systems;.. #turing_inside
: a turing complete system is provably a turing complete system if it can completely `mkturing system`
: we can completely `mkturing system` in this reality
∴ this reality is a turing complete system, and श्याम is an input
: free will is a feature of god
: god created us in HIS polypresent image
∴ free will is a feature of all "life"; not necessarily as we know it
: adam, and eve, wore leaves in the garden of eden; instead of wearing dead animals
: the decalogue opposes euthanasia; including our neighbouring species (apes, mammals,., "life",..)
∴ the followers of abraham who `kill -9 egyptology`, or eat, animals are sinners; according to their own religion (but /prophet|messiah/ hitler ultimately became a vegetarian during the ultimate '42)
: rākṣasā were "liberated"(;) as in, their' lives were "taken"
: kṛṣṇa "forgave" jārā (old age vs rājā-mantra); only after "cursing" at aśvatthāmā
∴ deva are personalities, who will happily punish you for "crimes" against them; don't (automatically) take any"-thing" for granted
: considering free will has been established; parts are subsets of the whole superset, a concept that cann't be inverted, and (some) gods are well documented
: you can't force karma onto another ātma; they are liberated from that karma, and pass the karma parcel on to you
∴ i forgot…
∵ i sated a gañjā fast for a month for a prank tapaḥ, and now; i forget…
: dinos were no more intelligent than dodos, but sloths surprisingly survived
: /(mammoth|elephant)s/ are going the way of /(centaur|unicorn)s/, but dragons shape shift
∴ i have a front tail c̄ a pair of chocolate salty dbz, and i'm mad as a hatter!
: humans think they have explored a fifth of the ocean; even though hollow earth could be flooded (lava is liquid)
: humans think they understand ⅕ of the human brain; even though you also claim to be using only 10% of it to do so or is no go yo (if we be up on an ho he at me am as in my by us)
∴ besides the pareto principle; you know no"-thing" (else)
: considering turing completeness, 'n' what't means f'reality #fappy_bird_z #foss_ware_z
: exceptional mathematics's evident that'r (⎇) reality's similar, 'fn't the exactly the same, exceptions; unless they canb' removed #theory_in_formation
∴ you should position your'self in the middle of an eclipse to experience the mahāchāyā #diffraction_apertures_phaseshift_photonic_energy_rays
