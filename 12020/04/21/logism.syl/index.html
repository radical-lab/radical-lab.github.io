: any"-thing" that takes /inputs?/ can be turing complete; `id(X,X), =(X,"turing complete system").`; personality box rewrites; natural language comments ÷ turing complete systems;..
: a turing complete system is provably a turing complete system if it can completely `mkturing system`
: we can completely `mkturing system` in this reality
∴ this reality is a turing complete system, and श्याम is an input
: free will is a feature of god
: god created us in HIS polypresent image
∴ free will is a feature of all "life"; not necessarily as we know it
: adam, and eve, wore leaves in the garden of eden; instead of wearing dead animals
: the decalogue opposes euthanasia; including our neighbouring species (apes, mammals,., "life",..)
∴ the followers of abraham who `kill -9 egyptology`, or eat, animals are sinners; according to their own religion (but /prophet|messiah/ hitler ultimately became a vegetarian during the ultimate '42)
