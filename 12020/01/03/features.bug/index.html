odd accumulations mean श्याम is not prime; primes should not be able to factor higher than themselves, nor should geometry be rooted above its' self

wrap-around
xⁿ = x
x¹ = 0
x⁰ = 1 ⊻ 0
x¹ ≤ x⁰ &#60; … &#60; x³ &#60; x² &#60; x¹

x ↓ 3 = the root of a cube  ; a line of a cube
x ↓ 2 = the root of a square; a line of a square
x ↓ 1 = the root of a line  ; a line of a line
x ↓ 0 = the root of a point ;/a line of (a point|points)/
x ↓ 0 = x ↑ श्याम = 0×[x=0] +1×[x=1] +(x ↑ श्याम)[x∉{0,1}]
(x ↓ 0) ↑ 0 = (x ↑ 0) ↓ 0
x ↓ (0÷0) = x ↑ (0÷0) = x ↓ (1÷0) = x ↑ (0÷1) ≠ x ↓ (0÷1) = x ↑ (1÷0)

the idea for teapot started when i was studying perl 5, and i remember appending it to the end of the script; there was probably something there, but it's all backed up, and i only remember playing around with the title, and maybe some content/plan, and some other ideas for other publications; i remember losing it all multiple times, and discovered how to grep for deleted files, which takes forever to find something even remotely close to the last save, since i save so often
i should look this up; what are the other publications?

n÷d, where d⊃{∓0,∓1÷[x],∓1,∓[n]} ∧ d=[d]
1÷0, where r=1

∀x: x⁰ = x÷x
∨
∀x: x⁰ = 1

∀ x: P(x) means P(x) is true "for all" x.
A x: P(x) means P(x) is true "for atleast a" x.
A!x: P(x) means P(x) is true "for a" x.
A¬x: P(x) means P(x) is true "for &#60;1" x.
E x: P(x) means P(x) is true "for each, and every" x.
∃ x: P(x), means P(x) is true "for ≥1" x.
∃!x: P(x), means P(x) is true "for =1" x.
∃¬x: P(x), means P(x) is true "for &#60;1" x.

decimals c̄out decimals
.x=1÷(bˣ)
.x=1÷(xᵇ)
there's some way of doing this to say that .1=(1÷(1¹))=1, and i'm sure it has some"-thing" to do c̄ the base

E=mp¹
x÷y = (m÷p)[p≤m]+(p÷m)[m&#60;p]
x÷y = (m÷p)[p&#60;m]+(p÷m)[m≤p]
y÷x = (m÷p)[m≤p]+(p÷m)[p&#60;m]
y÷x = (m÷p)[m&#60;p]+(p÷m)[p≤m]
TODO: check mutually exclusive inequalities
E=(⌊x÷4⌋+√(x-4⌊x÷4⌋)÷2)[0&#60;x]
average distance between m, and p
E=logₙ₊₁(x-n⌊x÷n⌋+1)+⌊x÷n⌋
oeis doesn't have {1,3,15,260}∋n for logₙ₊₁(x+1); log₂↑₂↑ₙ(x+1)
cosθ=(∑mp)÷(∥m∥·∥p∥)

the yearly teapot c̄ intricate patterns; probably not yearly ∵ i'm not that interested in mathematics…
?- sort([Life], TM, Man).

elemental balance is black=water, brown=earth, red=fire, blonde=air
atomic floaters are fairies, angels, magic, midichlorians,.. (best to show people for the first time; after showing them gañjā)
leprechaun rainbows are used for gold prospecting
australians have the best religion because the colourful water dragon still actually appears to us (technically always c̄ us in the humidity; rainbow breath), and by performing a water yajñá we can tell the colourful water dragon to visibly appear to us whenever we want; but it is best to include the goddess of light (hey; that is like brahmā is the creator of the day, the goddess of light who maintains the day (can appear anytime; unlike brahmā, and śiva, because mahāviṣṇu; clearly viṣṇu is superior, even during an eclipse), and śiva is the destroyer of the day (gañjā is only used after performing sūrya namaskār between when sūrya sets, and before midnight; between when sūrya sets, and when sūrya rises) (śiva also gave us the kāmasūtra; under the influence of gañjā) (𝄞3))
poly in polynesia is for polytheism
it was only two millenia ago that egyptians were polytheistic ∵ cleopatra was pharaoh, and julius was caesar; the followers of abraham are destroyers of culture to support their spin on history
abrahamic invasions, and forced missionaries; the followers of abraham are destroyers of culture to support their spin on history
rastafaris don't like isms, and ians, because their /messiah|prophet/ is ras tafari; ras tafaris' legacy, and he was killed by his own people, just like jesus was killed by the jews who wielded the romans as their /tool|weapon/, but he didn't like gañjā as much as śiva
there are many abrahamic /messiah|prophet/ alive today, but i remain a hindu; many people can walk on water, and levitate, but dynamo created fish (defying physics; conservation of mass), but i don't keep up with the latest trending miracles anymore, so maybe there's a more appropriate candidate?
adam, and eve, didn't follow judaism, nor christianity, nor muslims; they were sinners who defied god, and semites are their descendents, and christians worship one of them
the vatican are nazi supporters ∴ all catholics are nazi supporters; christians in rome, not the holy land ∵ the roman empire never fell, and that's why months are still named after roman polytheism ∵ the romans aren't jews, and the romans killed jesus ∵ jesus wanted to be king so he could conspire to perform מלחמת מצווה on them ∴ the roman catholics were very big supporters when the nazis wanted to throw the jews down the well so their country could be free
the vatican, the germans, and the japanese, all have symbolism dissassociated c̄ nazis; only my flag remains, and time is relative ∴ it was mine all of along
muslims hate any personification of muhammad, but don't complain about the personification of abraham, adam, eve, noah, moses, jesus, angels, god,.. (muhammads' tomb has his genetic material for personification, but muslims are afraid of what it will look like; cowards!!! q:D) (radiocarbon dating revealed the shroud of turin as fake ∵ the descendents of sinners follow a fake religion इति सिद्धम्)
all muslim uncles must expect to be murdered by their' muslim nephews; otherwise their' nephews aren't following muhammad, and must be murdered, because that is what muhammad would do
muhammad socially engineered all the unintelligent poor nephews to kill their intelligent rich uncles, thereby removing intelligence from the arab gene pool; idiocracy (2006)
microplastics, and birth defects (not just mental disabilities)
if you blow into somebodies' uranus, like a didgeridoo; will it make them burp? (babies have shorter digestive systems; because they're special relatively smaller)
if you blow into their lungs, they could die from the extra CO₂ poisoning; probably before they even farted
if you avoid the goddess of light; will male circadian rhythms naturally match mars, and female circadian rhythms naturally match venus?
my circadian rhythm is faster than the earth spins, unless i keep it in check; not a martian, but my homeworld is not this one either
dope in dope is for dopamine, which helps you sleep into a lucid dream; "wetdream" versus "drydream" (jizz wizard vs. dream wizard; for lack of a better comic)
i want to observe what a brain to computer interface would observe during every combination of (lucid) dreams, gañjā, orgasm, /mediation|hypnosis/, prāṇāyāma, /hot|cold/ temperatures, /electrocution|electroplay/, influential books, music genres (religious), movie genres (horror), rollercoaster, vehicle accidents, pain (break a leg), death (i'm on a boat, and…i'm burning it down; surfin' down the gaṅgā, through a holy town),..
