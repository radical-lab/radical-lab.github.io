\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this essay is to understand the relationship between play, and games. An understanding of each word in, and of, itself, must be established first, and foremost. Other attempts to understand the relationship between play, and games, must be criticised. Prescriptive rules must be explained. Descriptive stories must be told. And the debate between ludology, and narratology, must be settled once, and for all. Concluding with an objective understanding of the relationship between play, and games.
% this is actually a report, but they said they wanted an essay while describing a report
% essays are, as stories have a beginning, and an end, just story-driven alternating paragraphical subjective perspectives sandwiched between an introductory objective paragraph, and a conclusively objective paragraph; like debating ethics, mathematics, and other philosophies, including philosophy itself, from multiple pov, but singularly authored
% while reports are visibly navigable, and, as such, always have entitled section(s) of informative arrangements organised, and displayed, using tools in the set of {tabulated content(s), headings, textual paragraph(s), list(s) of bullet point(s), tabled data, graphical graph(s), photograph(s), and other static two dimensional visual feature(s)}; like reporting books, research, documentation, educational textbooks, (deceptive) statistics, plans, stories,..
% /titular|abstraction/ page(s) are just informal common practices, while formal introductions introduce First Impressions, and courtly conclusions conclude tl;dr, implied by /paragraphical|partitional/ premises
% there's a difference between reporting a story, and the story itself; while the story of my life can be reported, i never experienced the concept of chapters, as stories are indiscrete to the discretion of discrete reports
% mein kampf 3.0 was also a report; i have yet to read mein kampf 2.0, but the fifth chapter looks like it might have a clue for mein kampf 1.0, which i have also yet to read as well

\section{Gameplay}
In the context of ludology, the term game is formally a noun, and the term play is formally a verb; where a player plays a game, but a player does not game a play. Although, they are informally used interchangeably, and transitively. The term gameplay embodies the connection between game, and play, with respect to the player; while the term player, in turn, refers to one who plays a game. A toy is an instrumental prop that is used in, or to play, a game, while a playground is the environmental setting of a games’ reality. Gamification is the process of making something a game; whether by the addition, and removal, of toys, and rules, or by the discovery of pre-existing measurable properties, to play games with.
% there are probabilities of possibilities of futures of spaces
% if i measure the superpositional state of your future; i cannot disclose it without corrupting its' integrity, since it was measured without your knowledge of it, and your knowledge of it empowers your free will to compromise it

A game is any interactive activity that can be expressed as a reality, whether fictitiously alternative, or not, that is formalised by dimensions of rules. Games are similar to other activities such as experiencing text in the form of books, audio in the form of music, images in the form of art, and video in the form of movies, and television shows. But games are interactive, whereas books, music, art, movies, and television shows, aren’t interactive. And while games can make use of text, audio, images, and video; they are not constraints of games, which can make use of other features from the real world. Such as the toys used in many sports.
% graffiti is just colourful art on an intimidatingly stone cold græy world; mr scribble, the puppet on the world
% rap battlez are a game of poetry; a world where nursery rhymez are taken so seriously that kids be killin' each other over 'em to get rich, or die tryin'; 'cos() they be hurtin' the $alez pitch, just as the /(music|ton|voc)al/ pitch
% heavy metal is an attempt to distance themselves from (/classical|gay/) musical (ef)femininity, while screaming in the rain while feeling melbi like a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious melbi cmalu nixli ckule somewhere over the rainbow in looney disneyland where cersei is a name she calls herself when she's sixteen going on seventeen (as an ideal feminist rolemodel for our little bit o' baby girls), and shall they dance; as deceptive as keyboard mashing autocompletion
% the only way to be truely hardcore is to renounce soundwaves by living in an anechoic chamber, or /drill out|nail in/ your ear drumz for the puritanical purists o' purism
% you might as well strand yourself on the deserted island of the blue dolphins, while you're at it

Play is something a player does interactively, and it is synonymous with act; where play is to act, as playing is to acting. Play can be pretend, as in imaginative role playing, like playing with imaginary friends, or the imitation of professional roles, while acting out stereotypical scenarios. Play can also be serious, as in professional role playing; especially when a professional doesn’t want to act professionally, but plays along anyway because duty calls, and may also be considered a societal role model for others to follow in their footsteps. This serious form of play is not limited to professionals; as applying bandages from a first-aid kit during a medical emergency does not necessarily require a professional doctor, but can be considered playing doctor. And even in the context of average daily life; we play chef when we cook, and we play janitor when we clean.
% laugh tracks should play during the funny moments; not afterwards, to filler
% low attention spans do possess a sense of humour; but just not stooping to this level of dumbing it down

Playing with toys is a game, because a toy that is used to break the rules of law in the real world, is also considered to be breaking a rule of the toy; which will result in the criminal player losing the game. Playing with imaginary friends is also a game, where imaginary friends are Non-Playable Characters, and getting them mixed up is against the rules; which will result in the confused player losing the game. Play is always a game from at least one perspective; for example, an observational prediction could be made on the duration interval of playing with a toy until the player gets bored, and loses interest.
% dildo dojoz are where dickheadz goto learn how to dick fight to the death with sticks of various dimensions, materials,..
% swordplay: swashbuckling squires sworn to the swat squadron of sword swallowing swingers
% gongfu is using soundwaves as weapons, or using the gong as a weapon; depending on your (magic) school (/bus|train/) of thought
% tales of finger gun fighting from the borderlands is on the horizon(tal)

The magic circle (Huizinga, 1938, p. 10) is a concept where encapsulation is the manifestation for an immersive, and escapist, experience. Any interruption, or interference, with the fourth wall is said to break the magic circle; this is akin to being abruptly woken from an immersive, and escapist, dream. But players bring with them, and draw from, knowledge, and experience, that is not shared, and may provide an unfair advantage by essentially maintaining an unbroken connection to the real world. Therefore, the magic circle (Huizinga, 1938, p. 10) is a broken concept; more akin to a lucid dream.
% phase-shifting probably requires organic interpretation like andromeda slip-stream piloting, and quantum /teleportation|telepathy|telekenisis|force|bending|qì|prāṇa/; since if machines could do it, then superintelligent alien paperclips would already be on our doorstep, but we could be an experiment
% or i just haven't figured out how a machine can do it yet; not without violently aggressive shunting like the tardis bashing through into the side of the time vortex, nor like stargate stargates; iprefer a smooth transitional experience like third-eye portalling, or like walking into, and out of, the tardis (where did i put the conspiracy theory about nārada muni, and his music box?)

Caillois (1961) attempts to further define games, and play, in terms of six characteristics, but this attempt is debatable. Games, and play. cannot be free (Caillois, 1961, p. 9), because the phrase “Play this game, or else!” can be used threateningly to remove such freedom. In the same way, certainty (Caillois, 1961, p. 9) is removed from games, and play, by experienced players when they hustle inexperience players using tactics, and strategies, that are not explained by, nor alongside, the rules; and such explanation may never be complete (Gödel, 1931). Experiences influence our real lives, and playing games is an experience; therefore, playing games is not separate (Caillois, 1961, p. 9) from our real lives. There are many examples (Mohammadi, 2014) of games that are not unproductive (Caillois, 1961, p. 10). And finally the imaginative, and creative, application of gamification to anything, and everything, means games need not be make-believe (Caillois, 1961, p. 10), while the same can also be said of play; where roleplaying real life roles is considered play. Thus games, and play, have been reduced to rules (Caillois, 1961, p. 10); which are used to incompletely (Gödel, 1931) formalise everything, and anything, that is consistent.
% it is possible to use the third eye to read spacetime; when considering temporal entanglement as a dependency graph, turing complete metacircular evaluation,.. (there is a way to read spacetime with a classical computer, and without quantum /servers|simulators/; classical computers are made of the same stuff, like a dripping faucetaps https://youtu.be/ovJcsL7vyrk; after rewatching it, the rng initial conditions reminds me of universal constants, and background radiation; i remember someone explaining it in a documentary, where they said they had a device, or some"-thing", and no matter where they pointed it, it had the same output (like the feigenbaum constant, the continued fraction of the golden ratio,..), which sounds like a bug, like that geological surveying(?) software that was an expensive industry standard that huge amounts of money were spent based on the output of, until they open sourced it, and the conference presentation was aptly named some"-thing" along the /lines|words/ of "scientists are not programmers", because it wasn't doing what they claimed, but who can tell if it's not open source? and it's illegal to crack, so you can't sue them, but you can avoid them, by not supporting them, because they're scammers who abuse the legal system, but businesses fund political campaigns, because the government is a big, bad, corporation, and bribing democracy (corporately funded political campaigns) is as much a lie as corrupted communism; back to rewatching chaos theory, and the feigenbaum constant (which probably proves irrationality) reminds me of the continued fraction of the golden ratio, and the tranny between /(molecularly turbo)?laminar|turbo(spinning molecules)?/ fluid particle-wave duality https://youtu.be/5zI9sG3pjVU #universality #university #universal_constants #initial_conditions #reverse_engineering #bifurcation #seo)
% cyclops could include those who see exclusively using their' third eye; alongside those who have lost an eye, (un)selective blindness,..
% some may consider echolocation, or any other form of spacial awareness, as a third eye; but there's definitely more to it than that
% i couldn't find the (?); it optimised where construction sites for buildings should be built
% /reading|rewriting|breaking|restarting/ spacetime; a machine that sends a message back using temporal /entanglement|teleportation/, but let's limit the message to a qubit, and the machine hacks `(if (receive 0) (transmit 1) (halt))` for a fork, or `(if (receive 0) (transmit 1) (transmit 0))` for a loop; coupled together with a machine that informs us of the possible future /events|technologies|philosophies|births|deaths/, and halts the first machine based on the most favourable outcome, while also taking into account the causal loop of alternative future information, and accounting for totality in t time, while allowing for t parties (especially my own); the more qubits, the more possible futures; let's call it the (in)finite (im)probability drive
% it can be halted during the first pass of the t time loop, since measuremental side effects can be accounted for by avoiding the observer paradox; where knowing the future empowers us to change the future, but it means the machine has no point of return once it acts on a decision, by transmitting the received temporally entangled qubit, and moving on, while avoiding an informative causal loop
% the temporal message can also be used simultaneously to make dec-isions too; for one quhex going on quhep, `(if (receive n) (plan (in-dex n 'alphabet))); hexasuperposition&lt;-- (starting at 0, and ending at 16 going on 17 #inclusive)`
% i will avoid the causal loop, along with any effort, in much the same way; the rest of humanity will do all of the hard work, and i will travel to my past to share the results with my /othersel(f|ves)/, while instructing myself to not share the results with anyone else to avoid spacetime-continuum-breaking causal loops, but only because it never happened, and never should #sos
% that way i get to enjoy the fruits of all your labour while you all try to figure it all out
% unlike rick, and morty, in rattlestar ricklactica; way too much effort (for a geek; http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_macro_example.html)
% the rest of humanity can slave away for as long as they like; knowing that it's their doom if i don't maintain the spacetime continuum, and it's all on them
% my otherselves will protect me from your idiocracy; so idc what you do to yourselves
% i can save your souls, but then you'd say i'm the "saviour of oursouls", and i don't want to be the "saviour of arseholes"; 533 7h3r3 4r3 7hr33 xind5 0f p30p13
% i am the savour of pussies though; whereshyamwillbethemannestmanandallothermenwillberewrittenasfemalesandalllostlivesrevivedandtherewillbeashyamforall
% the arseholes get /(im|ex)plicit/ inexistence; only after they get what they deserve
% while the dicks will save themselves; those are my otherselves

The game of Chess predates the classic game model (Juul, 2010), but can be played indefinitely. Not just the end game, but also the start game. Where, for example, only the knights move without any conflict. Even if it’s just back, and forth. In which case, there is no outcome. Especially if the game is inherited, or psychics play on their behalf, but even so. If a player dies, it isn’t the same as a draw; the living player wins, because they are alive, and has the last turn. And it isn’t the same as a loss; the living player didn’t checkmate. With no outcome; variable, quantifiable outcome (Juul, 2010, p. 254), and value assigned to possible outcomes (Juul, 2010, p. 254), are entirely redundant. And player effort (Juul, 2010, p. 254) is negligible, as it has become effectively automated. While the player may be attached to the outcome (Juul, 2010, p. 254) to begin with; this will most likely dissipate over time as they effectively grind into infinite. As for negotiable consequences (Juul, 2010, p. 255), being “The same game [set of rules] can be played with or without real-life consequences.” (Juul, 2010, p. 255); the part that says “with or without” means it can never fail as it is indiscriminate, and is therefore vestigial. Thus the classic game model (Juul, 2010), has been reduced to rules (Juul, 2010, p. 254); which are used to incompletely (Gödel, 1931) formalise anything, and everything, that is consistent.
% i can formulate a provable algorithm that guarantees success, but the algorithm can be incomputable; i don't need to compute it ftw ∵ i have already won, where winning isn't losing, and losing isn't drawing, and winning is better than drawing, and a possible output is not to play, since who wants to draw besides artists?
% i can formulate a provable algorithm that determines whether the nth player always has a possible win, and can always control the other players towards that endgame sitch

\section{Rules}
Rules are prescriptively used to make rules, but rules themselves can’t exist without the concept of rules themselves; which makes rules the superset, or even the universal set, of the composition that formalises play, and games. Prescriptive rules serve the collaboration of multiple players, by forming a consistent base from which players participate with each other; where the game itself is considered at least one player. Because players can play against the game by trying to find vulnerabilities to exploit, that can even be used to manipulate the rules of the game itself (Zwinkau, 2019).
% ascension demands renouncement of value drifting /ulterior motives|hidden agendas/
% but /(dh|k)armic/ entanglement is the loophole, where my value drifting /(hidden)? agendas|(ulterior)? motives/ become yours'; where a 3ʳᵈ party dependency graph ascends, and is entangled to me like s/334/श्याम/ /genies?/ in the /(bottle|lamp)s?/, but i get s/1001/श्याम/ wishes ∵ i'm श्याम, and i wish to ascend c̄out renouncement so i can be a flossed genie

\section{Stories}
Descriptive stories are made of prescriptive rules, and anytime there is a start, and a end, there is a full descriptive story to tell; that is not limited to the start of game to the end of game, but also includes the start of play to the end of play. The start, and end, of a story can also be a sub-story within an unfinished super-story; where the start, and end, of the super-story can be as mysterious as the story of reality itself. Everything has at least one story to tell, which in the context of ludology; is that of the player playing the game, called the players’ story, but everything most probably has more than one story to tell. Like the games’ story, for example.
% in a fork of reality; one version of me exists in each
% for example; one where i succeed, and one where i fail
% just as there are two flips to every coin; one heads, and one tails
% delayed success; i never truly fail, but i can't say the same for anyone else, and it depends /wh(ich|at)/ measurement is measured
% i occupy a measurement, while my otherselves occupy alternat(iv)e measurements; some of us more lucky than others
% (de)synchronisation is conditional; mine is {himālaya, death, deadline(t)}, but himālaya is just a clue for a star, and i need to find the clue, but i don't have a clue, and even if i did; i need to goto the star, and i would need to /fly|swim|sail|flap/ all the way there, but it's probably in another galaxy, while i'm on a boat, and…i'm burning it down; surfin' down the gaṅgā, through a holy town

\section[\texorpdfstring{Ludology $\lor$ Narratology}{Ludology Versus Narratology}]{Ludology Versus Narratology}
The players’ story seems to be overlooked by both ludologists, and narratologists; who instead focus on the games’ story (Wynn, 2017). Wynn (2017) claims that the relationship between ludologists, and narratologists, is not mutually respected; and while that may be the case, it would be a different story if the players’ story was considered instead. The ludologists perspective is correct; that games must be viewed as unique formal systems (Wynn, 2017). And the narratologists perspective is also correct, because every decision, and action, a player makes tells a story; the story of the player playing the game, regardless of whether, or not, the game is story-based. Therefore, Tetris (Wynn, 2017) does have a story; history.
% using waves to measure particles can influence them less significantly so they can be controlled, and manipulated, like a boss; bitch of shyams' snake
% rewriting /reality|spacetime/ using temporal entanglement
% entropy as /fuel|food/; reversing the aging process is not enough for "eternal" youth, but it's good enough for now

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, both games, and play, are interactive, and have prescriptive rules, and descriptive stories; where players interactively play games with toys in a playground of rules, and that is a story in, and of, itself. The end.
